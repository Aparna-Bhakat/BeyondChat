❗Important Notice
I was facing issues with GitHub. My commit and push requests were being cancelled repeatedly for unknown reasons.Since my exams start on 27th June, I won’t be able to work on resolving this issue until after my exams.
For now, I have uploaded the project as a ZIP file. After 31st June, I will properly work on:
Fixing the GitHub issue
Improving UI and functionality
Enhancing the AI assistant feature


Thank You...............................
